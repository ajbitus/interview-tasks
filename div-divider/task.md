# Task - :black_square_button::heavy_division_sign: DivDivider

## Description

Maximum Time Limit: 1 hour

The task is to create a front end application using any front end framework (preferably React) or library with single primary view.

You can use any third-party open-source library you want, also additional feature or enhancement like testing will be acknowledged.

## Task

* It is a simple DOM manipulation task. Create a DIV element and a button with counter initially set to 0.
* On each click on button, counter should be incremented by 1 and number of dividers of the DIV element should increase by 1 either width-wise or height-wise.
* If the value of counter becomes **odd**, then number of dividers width-wise. And if the value of counter becomes **even**, then number of dividers height-wise.
* So, some of the first steps of this iteration will be:
..0 *INITIAL STATE* **COUNTER=0**  **BOX DIVISION = 1 x 1**
..1 *FIRST STEP* **COUNTER=1**  ** BOX BIVISION = 2 x 1 **
..3 *SECOND STEP* **COUNTER=2**  ** BOX BIVISION = 2 x 2 **
..1 *THIRD STEP* **COUNTER=3**  ** BOX BIVISION = 3 x 2 **
..1 *FOURTH STEP* **COUNTER=4**  ** BOX BIVISION = 3 x 3 **
