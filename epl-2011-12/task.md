The task is to create a front end application using any front end framework (preferably React using Redux) with single primary view.

For this task, below are the datasets you have to use:
* [teams.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajbitus/interview-tasks/master/epl-2011-12/teams.json)
* [matches.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajbitus/interview-tasks/master/epl-2011-12/matches.json)

You can use any third-party open-source library you want, also additional feature or enhancement will be acknowledged.

The primary view should have two sections:
1 Bubble Chart
1 Matches Table

### 1. Bubble Chart
